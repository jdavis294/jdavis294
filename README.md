Hello, my name is, Jalen Davis and I am an undergraduate at Georgia state university. I think people would say that I am a skilled communicator, in terms of speaking, writing, and listening. I am always eager to involve myself in opportunities to better prepare me for my career and personal development. I have developed great communication skills and demonstrated leadership through community service as well. I have a very proficient understanding of programming languages such as java and python. I am actively looking for software development internships to increase my experience and efficiency in the field.
